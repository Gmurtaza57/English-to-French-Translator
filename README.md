# **Translation From English to French Using Machine Learning**

This project aims to build a model that translates English text to French. It employs advanced machine learning techniques and deep learning architectures to facilitate the translation.

**Libraries Used**

- Tensorflow
- NLTK
- Gensim
- Spacy
- Plotly
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Keras

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is a collection of English sentences and their corresponding French translations. Both English and French datasets are processed separately and then merged for model training.

**Data Preprocessing**

In data preprocessing, the text is cleaned by removing punctuation marks and special characters. Tokenization is then applied to split the sentences into individual words. Padding is done to ensure that all sequences have the same length.

**Model Architecture**

The model uses the Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) approach which is a popular choice for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning. It comprises an encoder-decoder architecture:

- Encoder: This is a Bidirectional LSTM which reads the entire input sequence and encodes it into a context vector of fixed length, capturing the contextual information present in the input sequence.
- Decoder: The decoder is also an LSTM which reads the encoded input sequence and generates the output sequence.

The **RepeatVector** layer is used to specify the number of times the input should be repeated. The **TimeDistributed** layer is used to apply a Dense layer to each of the timestamps in the output sequence.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and the loss function used is sparse categorical cross entropy.

**Model Training**

The model is trained with a batch size of 1024 and validation split of 0.1 for 10 epochs.

**Model Evaluation**

The model performance is evaluated by making predictions on the test data and comparing the predicted translation with the actual French text.

**Installation**

Install dependencies using pip:

cssCopy code

pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu==2.0 pip install nltk pip install gensim pip install spacy pip install plotly

**Usage**

To use this model, input the English text and the model will output the corresponding French translation.

**Future Work**

- Increase the complexity of the model by adding more layers.
- Try different architectures like GRU or Transformer.
- Use a larger dataset for training to improve the model performance.
